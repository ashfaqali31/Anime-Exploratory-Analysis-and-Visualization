# Anime-Exploratory-Analysis-and-Visualization

**Anime Dataset Analysis Project**
This project explores and analyzes an anime dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Express, and Numpy. The goal of this project is to gain insights into various aspects of anime data, including genres, scores, popularity, release trends, and correlations between features.

**Project Overview**
The anime dataset contains 22 features for each title, including information such as:

Score: Viewer rating for each anime title.
Popularity: Popularity measure among viewers.
Genres: Categories or genres each anime belongs to.
Type: Format of the anime (e.g., TV series, movie).
Aired: Date range during which each anime aired.
Demographic: Target audience demographic (e.g., shounen, shoujo).
Through this project, I implemented:

1. Descriptive Statistics: Analyzed data distributions for key columns like score and popularity.
2. Visualizations: Created informative visuals, such as pie charts and scatter plots, to examine the most common genres, studios, and score distributions across demographics.
3. Correlations: Explored correlations between numerical features to uncover potential relationships.
